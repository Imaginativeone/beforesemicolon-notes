For a few years now, I've been working to fork this repository: https://github.com/ParadeTo/vue-tree-list
What I **really** want is to be able to code the Component in my sleep. Ultimately, I'd LOVE to be able to code it in Vanilla Javascript, Vue, REACT, 
Angular, Dojo, Ember, Go, Flutter, Swift, and Java.

I've Googled the topic, "Sortable Drag and Drop Trees" for years. I found useful resources here and there, but nothing like a YouTube channel I found 
recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3zGFmPWQVU&t=27s

This channel is amazing!

I've asked Elson Correia (https://beforesemicolon.com/) to help, and I'm amazed that he's open to help! (It's like a dream come true.) The approach that
Elson is taking is a bit [Socratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method), so I'm working on this repository in order refine my ideas and learn the most from studying these videos.
